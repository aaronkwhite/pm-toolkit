## Getting Started

### Installation

Install PM Toolkit from the marketplace:

- Cursor: Open the Extensions panel (Cmd+Shift+X), search for "PM Toolkit", and click Install
- VS Code: Same steps, or install from the Visual Studio Marketplace
- Open VSX: Available on Open VSX for alternative editors

### Opening the Editor

Open any .md file and PM Toolkit automatically activates. You'll see the visual editor instead of raw markdown. To switch back to the source view, click the View Source button in the editor toolbar.

## Visual Editor

PM Toolkit gives you a full WYSIWYG editing experience for markdown files. Built on React 18 and Tiptap, the editor renders formatted output in real time — headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and more appear instantly as you type.

Keyboard shortcuts for common formatting:

- Bold: Cmd+B
- Italic: Cmd+I
- Strikethrough: Cmd+Shift+X
- Inline code: Cmd+E
- Link: Cmd+K

### Block Handles

Hover near the left edge of any block to reveal drag handles. Drag any block to reorder it, or click the + button to insert new content between blocks.

### Bubble Menu

Select any text to see the floating toolbar. It gives quick access to:

- Block type (paragraph, headings 1-4, lists, quote, code block)
- Text formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough, code)
- Link insertion

### Document Outline

The sidebar shows a collapsible document outline generated from your headings. Click any heading to jump to that section. The outline updates in real time as you edit.

### Save Guard

Every save is validated before it touches your file. PM Toolkit blocks corrupted content — webview URIs, internal data attributes, or excessive HTML — from ever reaching disk.

## Slash Commands

Type / at the beginning of a new line to open the command menu. Available commands:

- /text — Plain text paragraph
- /h1, /h2, /h3, /h4 — Headings
- /bullet — Bullet list
- /numbered — Numbered list
- /task — Task list with checkboxes
- /table — Insert a table (with size picker)
- /code — Code block
- /quote — Blockquote
- /divider — Horizontal rule
- /image — Insert an image
- /link — Insert a link
- /mermaid — Mermaid diagram
- /flowchart — Mermaid flowchart
- /sequence — Mermaid sequence diagram

Templates you've created also appear in the slash command menu.

## Tables

Insert a table with /table and pick dimensions from the visual grid. Once inserted:

- Tab moves to the next cell, Shift+Tab moves back
- Grip handles on rows and columns for drag-to-reorder with drop indicators
- Right-click grip handles for insert, delete, and header row toggle
- Add bars appear on the last row and column for quick expansion
- Column widths persist, with horizontal scroll for wide tables
- Cmd+Enter exits the table to continue writing below
- Select all cells and press Delete to remove the entire table

## Images

PM Toolkit supports full image editing:

- Drop image files directly into the editor
- Paste images from your clipboard
- Browse for files using the file picker
- URL: Enter a web URL to embed an external image

Once inserted, click an image to:

- Resize by dragging corner handles
- Align left, center, or right using the floating toolbar
- Caption — toggle captions on or off (maps to markdown alt text)
- Replace or delete from the popover menu

Images are saved to a configurable assets directory (see Settings). Width and alignment are persisted as HTML comments in markdown.

## Kanban Boards

Create a file with the .kanban extension to open a kanban board. Boards are stored as markdown, so they're portable and version-control friendly.

- Drag and drop cards between columns
- Double-click a card to edit with rich text (Linear-style modal)
- Cards auto-complete when moved to "Done" or "Archive" columns
- Task counts shown per column
- Thumbnails display the first image from card descriptions
- Configure default columns and save delay in settings

## Mermaid Diagrams

Write mermaid diagrams inside fenced code blocks marked mermaid and they render inline. Alternatively, use slash commands:

- /mermaid — Generic mermaid block
- /flowchart — Flowchart diagram
- /sequence — Sequence diagram

Diagrams automatically adapt to your light/dark theme. They default to fit-to-view mode so the full diagram is always visible — toggle to scroll/zoom for large diagrams. Click the Edit button on any diagram to modify the source.

## Templates

Create reusable document templates:

1. Create a folder for your templates (any location in your workspace)
2. Set the folder path via PM Toolkit: Set Template Folder in the Command Palette, or in Settings
3. Add .md files with YAML frontmatter containing title and description

Available template variables:

- {{date}} — Current date (e.g., 2026-02-08)
- {{time}} — Current time (e.g., 14:30)
- {{datetime}} — Date and time
- {{year}} — Current year
- {{month}} — Current month
- {{day}} — Current day

Templates appear in the slash command menu alongside built-in commands.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Cmd+B — Bold
- Cmd+I — Italic
- Cmd+E — Inline code
- Cmd+K — Insert link
- Cmd+Shift+X — Strikethrough
- Cmd+Shift+7 — Numbered list
- Cmd+Shift+8 — Bullet list
- Cmd+Shift+9 — Task list
- Tab — Indent / next table cell
- Shift+Tab — Outdent / previous table cell
- Cmd+Enter — Exit code block or table
- / — Open slash command menu

On Windows/Linux, replace Cmd with Ctrl.

## FAQ

### The editor doesn't load when I open a markdown file
PM Toolkit activates when you open a .md file, but if the file was already open before installing the extension, VS Code won't automatically switch to the visual editor. Close the file tab and reopen it — the editor will load on the second open. You can also right-click the file tab, choose Reopen Editor With, and select PM Toolkit.

### Cursor shows an error after AI edits my markdown file
Cursor applies diffs to files lazily — when its AI agent edits a file, the changes are staged as pending diffs rather than written directly. If a custom editor (like PM Toolkit's visual editor) is open when this happens, the document state can get out of sync and you'll see an assertion error on reload. To fix it: save your document before letting Cursor's AI edit it.

### Can I switch between the visual editor and raw markdown?
Yes. Click the View Source button in the editor toolbar to see the raw markdown. Your changes are saved to the same file either way.

### Where are my files stored?
PM Toolkit edits your actual .md files on disk. Nothing is stored in a database or synced to the cloud. Your files stay exactly where you put them — portable, version-controllable, and fully yours.

### Does PM Toolkit work with Git?
Yes. Since it reads and writes standard markdown files, everything works with Git out of the box. Diffs, branches, merges — all normal.

### How much does PM Toolkit cost?
Nothing. PM Toolkit is completely free and open source. No trials, no tiers, no catch.

### How do I report a bug or request a feature?
Open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/aaronkwhite/pm-toolkit/issues
