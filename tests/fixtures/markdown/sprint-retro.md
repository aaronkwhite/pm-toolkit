## What Went Well 🎉

### Planning & Execution
- Started planning 6 months early (Leslie's binders paid off)
- Clear ownership for each area (vendors, entertainment, logistics)
- Daily standups kept everyone aligned
- Contingency plans for weather actually got used—and worked

### Team
- Cross-department collaboration was strong
- Volunteers exceeded expectations (thanks Ann!)
- Tom's social media campaign drove huge awareness
- Ron built 14 picnic tables in one weekend

### Highlights
- Li'l Sebastian appearance was the emotional peak
- Mouse Rat's 4-hour set (maybe too long but people loved it)
- Sweetums sponsorship covered 40% of costs
- Zero raccoon incidents (finally)

## What Didn't Go Well 😬

### Logistics
- Parking was a disaster on Saturday
  - Underestimated by 500 cars
  - Need overflow lot next year
- Porta-potty ratio was wrong (1:100 should be 1:75)

### Communication
- Vendor setup instructions were confusing
  - 3 vendors set up in wrong locations
  - Need better maps and signage
- Internal comms broke down Sunday morning
  - Radio channel got crowded
  - Designate separate channels per area

### Scope Creep
- Corn maze added last minute caused stress
- Should have cut the "guess the cow's weight" contest
- Too many food vendors in one area created bottleneck

- [ ] @Leslie - Document parking overflow solution
